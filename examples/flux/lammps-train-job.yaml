# This example deploys the LAMMPS Molecular Dynamic Simulator
# with MPI orchestrated by the Flux workload manager on 4 nodes.
# The problem size is defined by the coordinates x,y,z, and the
# parameter file reaxc.hns.
# The image has the application, LAMMPS, installed (no Flux)
# A Flux view will be added on the fly by the Kubeflow trainer
# The 4 pods ideally map 1:1 to nodes, encompassing a cluster
# The underlying abstraction is a JobSet with a headless service
# Flux supports low-latency with Infiniband, EFA, etc., however
# standard ethernet is used here.
