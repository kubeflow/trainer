# Comprehensive PR Review

Run a comprehensive pull request review using multiple specialized agents, each focusing on a different aspect of code quality.

In the review body message keep it minimal: thank the contributor for their work and note that the review was done using AI tools. Do not include summaries or aggregated findings in the review body — only post inline comments on specific lines.

Keep the inline comment text boxes small with suggestions or action items user needs to perform to improve PR.

**Prefer GitHub suggestions over prose comments.** Whenever a finding can be expressed as a concrete code change, post it as a committable GitHub `suggestion` block so the author can apply it in one click — do NOT describe the change in words. See [Comment Format: Prefer Suggestions](#comment-format-prefer-suggestions) for the mechanics. Only fall back to a plain prose comment when a suggestion is not feasible (see that section for when).

Before posting on GitHub ALWAYS print all proposed comments and the organized summary in the terminal for human review. The summary is for local reference only and must NOT be posted to GitHub.

## Comment Format: Prefer Suggestions

The default and preferred format for every actionable inline comment is a GitHub suggested change. A suggestion renders a "Commit suggestion" button, so the author applies the fix without hand-editing.

**Rules for writing a suggestion:**

- The comment body must contain a fenced block using the ` ```suggestion ` language tag. The lines inside the block REPLACE the anchored line(s) verbatim.
- Anchor the comment to the EXACT line(s) the block replaces. For a single line, set `line` (and `side`). For a multi-line replacement, set `start_line` + `line` (and `start_side` + `side`) so the range covers every line being replaced.
- The block content must be the complete replacement for the anchored range, with correct indentation — GitHub swaps in exactly what you write.
- Keep a one-line explanation (the "why") above the block; keep it short.

Example comment body posted via `gh api .../reviews`:

````markdown
Rename to match the suite directory:

```suggestion
package statusserver
```
````

**When to use a plain prose comment instead** (suggestion not feasible):

- The fix spans multiple files, or lines not present in the diff hunk.
- The change is conceptual/architectural (e.g. "extract this into a helper", "add a test for X") with no single obvious replacement.
- You are uncertain of the exact replacement and would be guessing at indentation or surrounding context.

In these cases, post a small prose comment with a clear action item instead of a low-confidence suggestion.

**Review Aspects (optional):** "$ARGUMENTS"

## Review Workflow:

1. **Determine Review Scope**
   - Check git status to identify changed files
   - Parse arguments to see if user requested specific review aspects
   - Default: Run all applicable reviews

2. **Available Review Aspects:**
   - **comments** - Analyze code comment accuracy and maintainability
   - **tests** - Review test coverage quality and completeness
   - **errors** - Check error handling for silent failures
   - **types** - Analyze type design and invariants (if new types added)
   - **code** - General code review for project guidelines
   - **simplify** - Simplify code for clarity and maintainability
   - **all** - Run all applicable reviews (default)

3. **Identify Changed Files**
   - Run `git diff --name-only` to see modified files
   - Check if PR already exists: `gh pr view`
   - Identify file types and what reviews apply

4. **Determine Applicable Reviews**

   Based on changes:
   - **Always applicable**: code-reviewer (general quality)
   - **If test files changed**: pr-test-analyzer
   - **If comments/docs added**: comment-analyzer
   - **If error handling changed**: silent-failure-hunter
   - **If types added/modified**: type-design-analyzer
   - **After passing review**: code-simplifier (polish and refine)

5. **Launch Review Agents**

   Each agent's instructions live in [agents/](agents/) next to this file (e.g. `agents/code-reviewer.md`).
   If an agent with that name is registered in your environment, use it. Otherwise, launch a
   general-purpose subagent and pass the body of the matching file as its prompt, followed by the
   review scope (PR number or changed files).

   **Sequential approach** (one at a time):
   - Easier to understand and act on
   - Each report is complete before next
   - Good for interactive review

   **Parallel approach** (user can request):
   - Launch all agents simultaneously
   - Faster for comprehensive review
   - Results come back together

6. **Aggregate Results**

   After agents complete, summarize:
   - **Critical Issues** (must fix before merge)
   - **Important Issues** (should fix)
   - **Suggestions** (nice to have)
   - **Positive Observations** (what's good)

7. **Provide Action Plan**

   Organize findings:

   ```markdown
   # PR Review Summary

   ## Critical Issues (X found)

   - [agent-name]: Issue description [file:line]

   ## Important Issues (X found)

   - [agent-name]: Issue description [file:line]

   ## Suggestions (X found)

   - [agent-name]: Suggestion [file:line]

   ## Strengths

   - What's well-done in this PR

   ## Recommended Action

   1. Fix critical issues first
   2. Address important issues
   3. Consider suggestions
   4. Re-run review after fixes
   ```

## Usage Examples:

**Full review (default):**

```
/review-pr
```

**Specific aspects:**

```
/review-pr tests errors
# Reviews only test coverage and error handling

/review-pr comments
# Reviews only code comments

/review-pr simplify
# Simplifies code after passing review
```

**Parallel review:**

```
/review-pr all parallel
# Launches all agents in parallel
```

## Agent Descriptions:

**comment-analyzer**:

- Verifies comment accuracy vs code
- Identifies comment rot
- Checks documentation completeness

**pr-test-analyzer**:

- Reviews behavioral test coverage
- Identifies critical gaps
- Evaluates test quality

**silent-failure-hunter**:

- Finds silent failures
- Reviews catch blocks
- Checks error logging

**type-design-analyzer**:

- Analyzes type encapsulation
- Reviews invariant expression
- Rates type design quality

**code-reviewer**:

- Checks AGENTS.md compliance
- Detects bugs and issues
- Reviews general code quality

**code-simplifier**:

- Simplifies complex code
- Improves clarity and readability
- Applies project standards
- Preserves functionality

## Tips:

- **Run early**: Before creating PR, not after
- **Focus on changes**: Agents analyze git diff by default
- **Address critical first**: Fix high-priority issues before lower priority
- **Re-run after fixes**: Verify issues are resolved
- **Use specific reviews**: Target specific aspects when you know the concern

## Workflow Integration:

**Before committing:**

```
1. Write code
2. Run: /review-pr code errors
3. Fix any critical issues
4. Commit
```

**Before creating PR:**

```
1. Stage all changes
2. Run: /review-pr all
3. Address all critical and important issues
4. Run specific reviews again to verify
5. Create PR
```

**After PR feedback:**

```
1. Make requested changes
2. Run targeted reviews based on feedback
3. Verify issues are resolved
4. Push updates
```

## Notes:

- Agents run autonomously and return detailed reports
- Each agent focuses on its specialty for deep analysis
- Results are actionable with specific file:line references
- Agents use appropriate models for their complexity
- Agent prompts are bundled in `agents/` next to this skill
